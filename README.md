# Movies_ETL

Extract, Transform, and Load or ETL is a very important step in organizing and getting data ready to be analyzed. The ETL process extracts data from different sources, transforms the data (cleaning the data, removing unneeded data, etc), and finally loads the data into a data warehouse system. 

## Purpose

Use the ETL data pipeline to extract wiki JSON data, Kaggle metadata, and movie ratings data. The data will then be transformed and loaded into an SQL database. This process will make the data cleaner and easier to understand and use for further analysis.
